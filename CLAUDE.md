# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new, empty project directory. The project type and architecture will be determined as development begins.

## Getting Started

Since this is a fresh project, the following steps may be needed:

1. Initialize the project with the appropriate technology stack
2. Set up build tools and dependency management
3. Configure testing framework
4. Establish code formatting and linting standards

## Development Commands

Commands will be added here once the project is initialized with a specific technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go, etc.).

## Architecture

Project architecture will be documented here as the codebase develops.
